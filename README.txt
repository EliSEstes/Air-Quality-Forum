Before you can do anything with the project site, you need to download the Django framework and the Python language.

You can do both of these by going to: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/

Follow the instructions given here to download both of these.

Once you've correctly installed them, you can move on.

Note: You do NOT need to install Apache. Just Django and Python.



To run the airquality project site, first download the entire airqualityproject folder.

Next, open your Command Prompt (also called Terminal or Powershell).

You should see the command line look something like: C:\Users\name\documents>

Whatever that command line says, is your default file directory for your Command Prompt.

Now, move the airqualityproject folder into that directory.

Type "cd airqualityproject" and press Enter.

Type "python manage.py runserver" and press Enter.

Open a web browser, type "localhost:8000" into your url bar, and press Enter.

The site should show up immediately.
